# DESIGN — arch/wasm for Zephyr

A record of decisions and the host ABI. Findings, measurements and dead ends
live in `NOTES.md`; the task statement lives in `BRIEF.md`.

## 1. Scope and shape

The kernel is built as a freestanding `wasm32-unknown-unknown` module. It owns
one linear memory. There is no host OS inside the module: no pthreads, no
`arch/posix`, no native_sim. Zephyr's own libc and scheduler are used.

The host (Node.js, `host/run.mjs`) plays the role of a SoC. Everything the
kernel would reach through memory-mapped registers is instead an imported
function in a single import module named `zephyr_host`.

Out of scope, as set by the brief: `CONFIG_USERSPACE`, MPU/MMU, SMP,
networking, Bluetooth, browsers, the stack-switching backend, upstreaming.

## 2. Decisions

### D1. Workspace layout
The module repo `zephyr-wasm/` is both the west manifest repo and the Zephyr
module. Zephyr is pinned in `west.yml` to main commit `e201b84b` (v4.4.99).
No Zephyr modules are imported; the port needs no HAL and uses the minimal libc.

### D2. Toolchain
Homebrew LLVM (clang + wasm-ld, matched versions) driven through a module-owned
toolchain variant `wasm-clang`. The Zephyr SDK's clang has no wasm32 target and
Apple clang ships no wasm-ld, so neither is usable as a pair.

`TOOLCHAIN_ROOT` is a single path and is not a `module.yml` setting, so the
module supplies the whole set: `cmake/toolchain/wasm-clang/`,
`cmake/compiler/wasm-clang/`, `cmake/linker/wasm-ld/`, `cmake/bintools/wasm/`.

### D3. Context switching: Asyncify, behind one interface
Switching goes through a single internal interface (`wasm_ctx_*` in
`arch/wasm/include/`), so a stack-switching backend can replace it later
without touching the rest of the arch. Backend chosen for this PoC: Binaryen
Asyncify.

### D4. Interrupts: cooperative, checked at safepoints
A pending-IRQ word in linear memory is set by the host and checked at
safepoints. `arch_irq_lock()` masks delivery rather than disabling anything in
the engine. Minimum safepoint is `arch_cpu_idle()`; loop back-edges come later
via an instrumentation pass (Milestone 3).

### D5. Determinism by default
The host runs on virtual time. When the kernel idles, the host jumps straight
to the next deadline. `--realtime` opts out.

## 3. Host ABI: import module `zephyr_host`

To be filled in as Milestone 1 lands. Sketch:

| Import | Signature | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `console_write` | `(ptr: i32, len: i32) -> ()` | console / printk char-out |
| `time_now_ns` | `() -> i64` | monotonic clock |
| `set_alarm_ns` | `(deadline: i64) -> ()` | program the next timer interrupt |
| `wait_for_event` | `() -> ()` | idle; suspension point under Asyncify |
| `fatal` | `(reason: i32, arg: i32) -> ()` | unrecoverable error |

Traps kill the instance and cannot be recovered from: a Wasm trap unwinds to
the host with no way back into the module. Fatal errors therefore go through
the `fatal` import, not through a trap, so the host can print a diagnosis.

## 4. Kernel features forced off

Every Kconfig this port forces off, with the reason. Filled in as they are hit.

## 5. Changes to the Zephyr tree

The Zephyr tree is read-only. Anything unavoidable becomes a numbered patch in
`patches/` with a comment. Currently: none.
